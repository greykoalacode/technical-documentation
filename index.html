          <h2>Introduction</h2>
        </header>
          <p><h3>What is C++ ?</h3></p>
          <p>C++ is a cross-platform language that can be used to create high-performance applications.</p>
          <p>C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell labs in 1979, as an extension to the C language.</p>
          <p>C++ gives programmers a high level of control over system resources and memory.</p>
          <p>The language was updated 3 major times in 2011, 2014, and 2017 to C++11, C++14, and C++17.</p>
          <p><h3>Why Use C++ ?</h3></p>
          <p>C++ is one of the world's most popular programming languages.</p>
          <p>C++ can be found in today's operating systems, Graphical User Interfaces, and embedded systems.</p>
          <p>C++ is a general purpose coding language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs.</p>
          <p>C++ is portable and can be used to develop applications that can be adapted to multiple platforms.</p>
          <p>C++ is fun and easy to learn!</p>
          <p>As C++ is close to C# and Java, it makes it easy for programmers to switch to C++ or vice versa</p>

      <section class="main-section" id="Hello_World">
        <header >
          <h2>Hello World</h2>
        </header>
        <p>A simple C++ program to display "Hello, World!" on the screen. Since, it's a very simple program, it is often used to illustrate the syntax of a programming language.</p>
        <code>
          #include < iostream>
            <br>int main() 
            <br>
            {
               <br> std::cout << "Hello, World!";
               <br> return 0;<br>
            }
        </code>
        <h3>Output:</h3>
        <code>
          Hello, World!
        </code>

          <h2>Datatypes</h2>
        </header>
        <div class="content">
          <p>All variables use data-type during declaration to restrict the type of data to be stored.</p><p> Therefore, we can say that data types are used to tell the variables the type of data it can store.</p><p> Whenever a variable is defined in C++, the compiler allocates some memory for that variable based on the data-type with which it is declared. Every data type requires a different amount of memory.</p>
          <h3>Primitive Datatypes in C++</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><h3>Integer</h3>
              <p>
                Keyword used for integer data types is int.</p><p> Integers typically requires 4 bytes of memory space and ranges from -2147483648 to 2147483647.</p></li>
            <li><h3>Character</h3>
              <p>
                Character data type is used for storing characters. Keyword used for character data type is char.</p></li>
            <li><h3>Boolean</h3>
              <p>
              Boolean data type is used for storing boolean or logical values. A boolean variable can store either true or false. Keyword used for boolean data type is bool.</p></li>
            <li><h3>Floating Point</h3>
              <p>
              Floating Point data type is used for storing single precision floating point values or decimal values. Keyword used for floating point data type is <strong>float</strong>.</p></li>
            <li><h3>Double Floating Point</h3><p>
              Double Floating Point data type is used for storing double precision floating point values or decimal values. Keyword used for double floating point data type is double.
            </p></li>
            <li><h3>void</h3>
              <p>
                Void means without any value. void datatype represents a valueless entity. Void data type is used for those function which does not returns a value.
            </p></li>
            <li><h3>Wide Character</h3>
            <p>
              Wide character data type is also a character data type but this data type has size greater than the normal 8-bit datatype. Represented by wchar_t.
            </p></li>

          <h2>Variables</h2>
        </header>
        <p>Variables are containers for storing data values.

          In C++, there are different types of variables (defined with different keywords), for example:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
              <p><strong>int</strong> - stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123</p>
          </li>
          <li>
              <p><strong>double</strong> - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99</p>
          </li>
          <li>
              <p><strong>char</strong> - stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by single quotes</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>string</strong>- stores text, such as "Hello World". String values are surrounded by double quotes</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p><strong>bool</strong>- stores values with two states: true or false</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Syntax:</h4>
        <code>
          <em>type variable = value;</em>
        </code>
        <br>
        <h4>Example:</h4>
        <code>
          int myNum = 15;
          <br>cout << myNum;
        </code>
        <h4>Output</h4>
        <code>
          15
        </code>

          <h2>Scope</h2>
        </header>
      <div class="content">
        <p>In general, the scope is defined as the extent up to which something can be worked with. In programming also the scope of a variable is defined as the extent of the program code within which the variable can we accessed or declared or worked with.</p><p> There are mainly two types of variable scopes:</p>

          <ol>
            <li><h3>Local Variables</h3>
                <p>Variables defined within a function or block are said to be local to those functions.
                  <ul>
                    <li>Anything between ‘{‘ and ‘}’ is said to inside a block.</li>
                    <li>Local variables do not exist outside the block in which they are declared, i.e. they can not be accessed or used outside that block.</li>
                    <li>Declaring local variables: Local variables are declared inside a block.</li>
                  </ul>
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Global Variables</h3>
              <p>
                As the name suggests, Global Variables can be accessed from any part of the program.
                <ul>
                  <li>They are available through out the life time of a program.</li>
                  <li>They are declared at the top of the program outside all of the functions or blocks.</li>
                  <li>Declaring global variables: Global variables are usually declared outside of all of the functions and blocks, at the top of the program. They can be accessed from any portion of the program.</li>
                </ul>
              </p>
            </li>
